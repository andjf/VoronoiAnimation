# Voronoi Animation
My attempt at an animated Voronoi diagram

Image generation and manipulation done by [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)

## `TODO`:
- Improve the performance of the `produce_voronoi` function (currently brute force `O(w * h * dots)`)
- ~~Support custom-defined colors~~
- Investigate more advanced ball movement
  - Circular movement
  - Parametrically-defined movement
  - Velocity flow field
